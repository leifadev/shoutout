# Language files!

This is a quick explanation for this directory.


### What is this?
By the default settings in shout out, you you inherit your tens of (or hundreds) of thousands
of words in a giant in volume of words, yet fairly small (don't worry about your disk space) file that stores
many words for all supported languages in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation format).


If you are peaking in here you probably have cloned the src code from git haha, well... hi lol

## Other settings

Before I go, I should also mentioned we (may) have a feature that allows you to fetch from the API for your words
live for anyone in settings! The reason why I give this limitation is because of the servers connection rate to acutally fetch
you data (the definition).

Cya and have fun building ;)
