# Language files!

This is a quick explanation for this directory.


### What is this?

When installing Shoutout!, you inherit around 20,000 json files that consist of words and their definitions in over a dozen
languages. Each file will be formatted in way:

```json
{
  "Außerirdischer": {
    "word": "außerirdischer",
    "partOfSpeech": "Adjective",
    "language": "German",
    "definitions": {
      "definition": "inflection of außerirdisch:\nstrong/mixed nominative masculine singular\nstrong genitive/dative feminine singular\nstrong genitive plural"
    }
  }
}
```

If you are peaking in here you probably have cloned the src code from git haha, well... hi lol


## Other settings

I should also mention we (may) have a feature that allows you to fetch word of the day words live online for reasons
regarding possible perks such as newer words that aren't already in the database. But after creating a database with 20,000
words and definitions, and internet connection speeds, and the fact that I have essentially maxed out my ability to
get more big batches new words for a while, I won't be adding this as of updating this file.


Cya and have fun browsing or building with the database! ;)
