## Version naming
> The build version number should be a string comprised of three non-negative, period-separated integers with the first integer being greater than zero—for example, 3.1.2. The string should only contain numeric (0-9) and period (.) characters. Leading zeros are truncated from each integer and will be ignored (that is, 1.02.3 is equivalent to 1.2.3). The meaning of each element is as follows:
>
>    The first number represents the most recent major release and is limited to a maximum length of four digits.
>
>    The second number represents the most recent significant revision and is limited to a maximum length of two digits.
>
>    The third number represents the most recent minor bug fix and is limited to a maximum length of two digits.
